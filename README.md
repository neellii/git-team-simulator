### This is all frontend website that will help you to understand how GIT and GitHub work for teams. It will be perfect for beginners, wanting to understand basic Git commands that will help to work in a team.

It will not take much of your time, but can give you clear understanding of basic GIT commands that are essential for every developer. Just stick to the scenario and you will be okay. 

Sources that I used:
